# BigQuery Tasks

## Notes
For as many of these tasks as possible I should show how to do it via:
* the web UI
* command line tools
* BigQuery REST APIs (e.g., Python)

## Tasks
* Query a public dataset
* Create a dataset
* Create a custom table
* Load the data into a new table
* Query a custom-loaded table
