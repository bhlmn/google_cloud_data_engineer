# Working with json data in BigQuery

*TL;DR* - summary and key points:

* BigQuery supports storing unstructured data as json-formatted strings
* BigQuery also supports functions that make it easy to extract key and value pairs from these strings, including nested objects
* Json-formatted strings can take up lots of space, so when using these functions pay attention to query costs!
