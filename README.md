# google_cloud_data_engineer

## Introduction

This is a repository/log/journal for my first [ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) project ... passing the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer Certification Exam in six months. The first commit to this repository was February 25, 2021, and my goal is to pass the certification exam by August 25, 2021. My goal is to put all of my notes and resources and projects related to achieving this goal on this repository. This will help me reach by reinforcing the following:

* Organizing my thoughts, notes, learnings, etc. using a simple markdown-based format.
* Getting me in the habit of committing to GitHub every day.
* Improve my writing capabilities.
* Logging everything I do to keep myself accountable and also provide a detailed account to others who might want to take on a similar ultralearning project.

## Inspiration

Two big inspirations for doing this.
1. [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com), the author of [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). I've always been an avid learner and love doing it, but since graduate school it has been very unfocussed learning (I have been busy after all!). I just read the book this year (February 2021), and it rekindled the fire for learning.
2. [Daniel Bourke](https://www.mrdbourke.com). Daniel is a self-taught machine learning engineer, writer, and creator who began diving into machine learning five years ago and hasn't looked back. He's a great example of ultralearning principles applied to my field.

## Project path and plan

- [ ] Make a list of everything I need to learn leveraging the exam guide.
- [ ] [Data Engineering on Google Cloud Platform Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-data-machine-learning)
- [ ] Build an automated data engineering project with GCP
- [ ] [A Cloud Guru Google Certified Professional Data Engineer](https://acloudguru.com/course/google-certified-professional-data-engineer)
- [ ] Build *another* data engineering project with GCP
- [ ] [Get GCP Certified Professional Data Engineer Bundle](https://www.getgcpcertified.com/p/professional-data-engineer-bundle)
- [ ] Practice exams
- [ ] Do the test!

All while organizing my notes as I'm learning and posting progress to medium on a bi-monthly basis.

## Learning habits

Here is the general day-to-day/week-to-week approach for this project:

1. I'll commit to giving this five hours a week. Hopefully I can dedicate a little more to it, but I'm a busy husband, dad, and employee, and an hour each weekday morning is about all that I can commit.
2. This project will get an hour of each morning's attention. My morning routine will be waking up at 5:30, a light exercise routine of 500 steps and 100 push-ups or 50 pull-ups, then diving in for an hour. I'll work in two 30-minute bursts separated by a five minute break so I can get some more steps in. After all, life isn't fun if you are sitting in front of a screen all day.
3. The hour of work will be structured as follows:
    1. Coursework/reading for 30 minutes.
    2. Five minute break.
    3. Building something for 30 minutes. This could either be labs
    4. Five minute break
    5. Summarize what I did in the daily log, save and commit notes/code, then on with my day!
4. Create a system of spaced repetition learning notes so that I can remember what I've learned, but I haven't figured out what exactly that is going to look like yet ...

One key thing I am really curious about is showing myself (and setting an example to others) what I can accomplish with just five hours a week. All it takes is focussed, intentive study and a plan. Surely everyone has five hours a week, right?

## Work log

* **February 26, 2021** - X hours. Updated this README, constructed a loose project plan and daily habit plan to be able to accomplish the project. 30 minutes of Coursera work.
* **February 25, 2021** - 2 hours. Created the repo, made it through 1.5 hours of the Google Data Engineering Coursera course.
